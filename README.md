# Fashion-MNIST-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 grayscale images of clothing items. The CNN architecture includes several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and dense layers for classification.
